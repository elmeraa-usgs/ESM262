## R


So that we all are working with the same code make sure you have the most recent version of
 
 * **R  (4.0.3 )**
 
 * **RStudio (1.3.1093)** installed,
 
 You will also need the following libraries to get started
 
    **tidyverse**
   

## Git


**GitHub**

From ESM  206 you already have a GitHub account, but if not
    [request a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

Make sure you include this in the initial survey on Gauchospace

- There is a lot of information on the web that you can use to refresh / learn to take advantage of **Git**
