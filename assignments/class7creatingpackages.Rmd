# <span style="color:orange">MODULAR PROGRAMMING</span>

* Modular Programming = breaking a big task into chunks

Why?

* easier to debug (find and correct mistakes)
* easier to re-use parts of the code
* easier to make changes

All programming languages haves ways to develop modules (*functions*)


# <span style="color:orange">MODULAR PROGRAMMING</span>

A program combines

* a controlling program that takes you through the steps required in some data science task
* modules that are "called" by the controlling program to perform specific tasks
* ideally modules are designed so that they can be used by many programs

The controlling program
* is called *main* in some (but not all languages)

* in R, the modules are organized in *packages*
  * collections of *functions*
  
* we use *Rscript* or *RMarkdown* for the controlling program

# <span style="color:orange">OUTLINE/FLOWCHART</span>

Modular programming starts with a diagram of your program

What are the tasks (*functions*) and what is the relationship
between them (steps, workflow, main program)

# <span style="color:orange">PACKAGES in R</span>

## <span style="color:orange">Definitions</span>

* **Package**: An extension of the R base system with functions, data and documentation in standardized
format.
* **Library**: A directory containing installed packages.
* **Repository**: A website providing packages for installation.
* **Source**: The original version of a package with human-readable text and code.
* **Binary**: A compiled version of a package with computer-readable text and code, may work only
on a specic platform.
* **Base packages**: Part of the R source tree, maintained by R Core.
* **Recommended packages**: Part of every R installation, but not necessarily maintained by R
Core.
* **Contributed packages**: All the rest. This does not mean that these packages are necessarily of
lesser quality than the above, e.g., many contributed packages on CRAN are written and
maintained by R Core members. They simply try to keep the base distribution as lean as
possible.
* **User packages**: Packages that you write, share with a smaller community - not downloadable
from CRAN, but can be downloaded (or sent as a zip file) and loaded into R

# <span style="color:orange">Why make packages</span>

* to easily share functions and data with others with R-specific documentation

* have a set of tools (functions) that you often use, that can be easily loaded

* be part of the R community


# <span style="color:orange">Making your own packages</span>

First lets review the format for writing functions

* documentation (we will say more on this later)

* function definition

* named **something.R**

* don't' have ANYTHING else in your **something.R** file

* Make sure you have version control set up to work with R  

#  <span style="color:orange">Installing User Packages</span>
* looks similar to CRAN packages

* uncompiled (they can be compiled but not always) so  you can **see** the code

You can load my package *rainbow* by 

  * downloading *rainbow.tar.gz *
    * DON'T UNZIP
  
  * install from a *package archive*
  
  
 Alternatively you can install from *github* - you need the *devtools* library to do this
 
 install_github("naomitague/rainbow")


Use of spring.summary
```{r packageapp, eval=FALSE}

 install_github("naomitague/rainbow")
# load "stuff" in your package including R
library(rainbow)


# notice
help(compute_NPV)
help(spring_summary)

```
# <span style="color:orange">Steps for starting a package</span>


* Think of a name for your package, it should be descriptive of the many related functions that you will store there
      * mine will be **rainbow**

* Create repository for this package on **git**

* Back in Rstudio,
  
  * Install libraries **devtools** from CRAN

  * start a new project, using the same name for the project as your package name
  
    * choose the option in package creation to **create a package**
    
    * make sure that the **path** to this directory is not in the course directory, or other directory that is 
already under version control (git)

    * link to your existing Github repository
    
* If you already have an R function you can add it here
  * make sure your function is named **something.R** and follows the format for functions that we have been using 
  * try adding one of the functions that you created to compute diversity
  


# <span style="color:orange">Making your own packages</span>

You will notice that this creates a directory structure that looks something like this

R Package Directory ![](Rdirstruct.jpeg)

Your R function will be stored in the **R** subdirectory
IF **man** and **data**, **tests** subdirectories are not created - created them

This package (e.g **rainbow**)  directory structures  store your code and documentation; that is easy for R to read. It include

* A file DESCRIPTION with descriptions of the package, author, and license conditions
* A man/ subdirectory of documentation files.
* An R/ subdirectory of R code.
* A data/ subdirectory of datasets.

# Working with yor package

# <span style="color:orange">How to work on your package</span>

Make a change to your R function, save it, then re-install  using either:

  * *Build* - *Build and Reload* from menu
  
  * *load_all()* command from command line

This will Load your functions in your package that is under-development

You can edit DESCRIPTION to add useful information particularly if you are going to share this package

It is useful to keep an Rmarkdown file or R script that lets you run your function - while you are working this should be stored *outside* of the package directory


I'll follow with my  **rainbow** package



Try this:
   * create a Rmarkdown file that you will use for using functions in your package
   * save it in a directory above where you are creating your package
   * in the Rmarkdown, provide code to generate some sample data, save it and read it in and apply your function to this data
   
   
#  How to to link back to Github (Just in case you didn't do this at the beginning)

* On *Github* create a new repository if you didn't create one above

* Back in Rstudio, in your project, in a *shell* window in your R studio, do the following

* make sure you are in the project directory (*pwd*)
* execute the following command

 *git remote add origin 'http link from git' * 
 
 then
 
 * *git pull origin master*
 
 * *git push -u origin master*
 
 Now your Project is linked with github and you can push/pull changes to github repo (when you are ready)
 Keep in mind that you can work locally to *play*
 
 Two setps to send stuff to github repo
 
 * commit locally
 
 * push to git hub
 
 * if you are collaborating or working on different machines its also good to pull regularly
